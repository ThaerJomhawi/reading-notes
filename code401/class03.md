# **Maps, primitives, File I/O**

## Primitives vs. Objects

* Two types of data in java :
  
1. Primitive => (int,Bolean)
2. Refernce => (Interger)

* primitive can be changed to a reference by a process called autoboxing and reversed by process called unboxing.

* chosing what to use is based on the app you are building.

* the primitive type variables have many impacts on the memory.

* primitive types live in the stack while the reference types live in the heap

* objects in Java not faster and do bigger memory impact on the other side of their primitive analogs.




## Exceptions in Java

* Exception is somthing happens during running of the program that inturpt it.
* Exception has an object which gives information about the error.
* The exception handler can catch the error in some cases.
  

## The Catch or Specify Requirement

* its a try statment or a handler to get what the Exception is.
* not all Exception can be handeld or catched.

* Exception kinds :
  1. checked exception
  2. error
  3. runtime exception


## Scanning:

- Scanner type Objects very useful making formatted input into tokens and change individual tokens by their data type.


### To use scanner
* The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.

* using Scanner class, you will  create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation.
