# Inheritance and Interfaces

## Objects :

* Java is an object oriented language 
* object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics, state and behavior. Understanding the concept of objects is much easier when we consider real-life examples around us because an object is simply a real-world entity.

## Class:

* is a group of objects that share common properties and behavior.


## Inheritance :

* is that child components can have the properties of the parent components and grandparent components and use them.
* the child components can have new properties thats not in the parents.
* the parents cant Inherit form the child .


## Interface:

* its what user can see and interact with like the buttons and other things that can lead to some action according to their usage .
* can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
