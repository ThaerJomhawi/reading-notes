# Object Oriented Design

## General code design principles: 

* one of the best things to do in  coding is not to repeat your code a lot and make it *DRY* 
* every part of the code should by clearly  identified 
* doing such things helps when changing something in the code that you don't need to change it a lot of places 
* using ode generators, automatic build systems, and scripting languages  can help a lot 

#### on the other side 
* not using the previous mentioned  methods can be called *WET* refering to the repeating in the code which can be waist of time 

#### another method AHA 
* makes changing better 
* users of AHA method sees the previous  two methods as hard to maintenance .


## Rule of three 

* its a main rule to rebuild the code and when to refactor the code 
* two similar of the code don't need refactoring but when three is a must 
* the cost of maintenance is much more than refactoring 


## You aren't gonna need it 

* one of the extreme rules in programming that tells us not to add any thing until its needed dot add even when you are not sure about it .



## Minimum Viable Product

* its about releasing a product that has the minimum and enough  features that you can get feed back from the users to develop .
