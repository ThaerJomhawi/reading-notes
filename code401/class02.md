# Arrays, Loops, Imports

## Packages and Import
The Package is the same as the directory, so A package name is the same as the directory name which contains the java files.

you can build a syntax to declare the package. The statement order can be Package statement, Imports statements or Class/ interface definitions.

Import tells the compiler where to look for symbols, The wildcard character (*) is used to specify that all classes with that package are available to your program.
You can import all classes or just the class you need , the most common programming style is the  JOptionPane class is in the swing package, which is located in the javax package.
GUI programs typically use at least the 
 java.awt.*
java.awt.event.*
javax.swing.*
Java 5 added an import static option that allows static variables (typically constants) to be referenced without qualifying them with a class name, Adding this "feature" wasn't the best idea because it leads to name pollution 
and confusion about which class constants come from.


## Java Loops

 a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached
There is a different types of loops that are available in the Java programming language like (forloop, while loop and do-while loop) where each loop serves a particular purpose given a suitable use case.
