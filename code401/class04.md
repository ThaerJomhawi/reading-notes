-	Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:

2-	Information-hiding
3-	Code re-use
4-	Pluggability and debugging ease

## Classes 
The Class is the first structure that used to build objects.

- Writing a class :
`class ClassName{
    //field,constructor,and;
    //methods;
}`


## variables

   fields,local variablesand and parameters.
