# Spring Boot and OAuth2

The samples are all single-page apps using Spring Boot and Spring Security on the back end. They also all use plain jQuery on the front end. But, the changes needed to convert to a different JavaScript framework or to use server-side rendering would be minimal.

1. simple: a very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login via Spring Boot’s OAuth 2.0 configuration properties (if you visit the home page, you will be automatically redirected to GitHub).

2. click: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.

3. logout: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.

4. two-providers: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.

5. custom-error: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API.

Securing the Application with GitHub and Spring Security
To make the application secure, you can simply add Spring Security as a dependency. Since you’re wanting to do a "social" login (delegate to GitHub), you should include the Spring Security OAuth 2.0 Client starter:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Add a New GitHub App**

To use GitHub’s OAuth 2.0 authentication system for login, you must first Add a new GitHub app.

Select "New OAuth App" and then the "Register a new OAuth application" page is presented. Enter an app name and description. Then, enter your app’s home page, which should be http://localhost:8080, in this case. Finally, indicate the Authorization callback URL as http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github and click Register Application.

The OAuth redirect URI is the path in the application that the end-user’s user-agent is redirected back to after they have authenticated with GitHub and have granted access to the application on the Authorize application page.
