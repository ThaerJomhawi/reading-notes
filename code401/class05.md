## Big O
when thinking of Big O you should consider 
- how algorithem works
- how much time its needs to run 
- how much space of memory needed


# Link List

- linked list : is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

- There are Two Types of linked lists: 
1. Singly
2. Double

- Definitions and abbreviations :
1. Linked list : Data Structures has nodes linked to other nodes.
2. Singly : means that the node has only one link.
3. Doubly : means that there is Two links fr the node 
4. node : element that has the data of the linked list 
   
- each node has a property called next has a refernce for the node 
  
## Traversal:

- To do Traversal its best to use the while Loops 
- When going through a linked list will allow us to move forward to the end 
- the Big O for the time  will be O(n) assuming the node we need is the last  and the Big O for the space O(1) because of no additional pace will add 


- Arrays are differant from linked list 
1. arrays :static data
2. linked lists : dynamic data
