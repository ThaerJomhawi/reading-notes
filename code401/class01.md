# **Java Basic**

### **Variables**

* Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields) “their values are unique to each instance of a class “
* Class Variables (Static Fields) “there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated”
* Local Variables “There is no special keyword designating a variable as local”
* Parameters “parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields"”

  
#### **Naming of variables**

* **Variable names are case-sensitive, So:**
 If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters.
 If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. 
 If your variable stores a constant value, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character.

* Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign "$", or the underscore character "_".

 | -       | Unary minus operator; negatesan expression                  |
 | ++      | Increment operator; increments a value by 1                 |
 | --      | Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1                 |
 | !       | Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean |
