# Images

**Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.**



You can control the size of an
image using the **`width`** and
**`height`** properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.



In the last chapter, you saw how
the **`float`** property can be used
to move an element to the left or
the right of its containing block,
allowing text to flow around it.



###  **Background Images**

The **`background-image`**
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.

**`repeat`**

The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the background repeat
property isn't used).

**`repeat-x`**

The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).

**`repeat-y`**

The image is repeated vertically
only.

**`no-repeat`**

The image is only shown once.
