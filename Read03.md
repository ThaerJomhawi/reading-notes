## **WireFrame**
It is more like a black and white abstract draft to a bigger project that we want to outreach

** Examples**

* Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.

*  With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end  users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.

* Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

### NOW : lets talk about semantics

In any language ***semantics*** is the linguistic meaning, but in programing : Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.
