# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

* HTML Describes the Structure of Pages

* In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly
the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.
You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen is in black.

# HTML5 Layout

* HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.
They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:
The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses How they offer helpful alternatives to the div> element
How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still
subject to change but it is already widely being used by web
developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.

# Process & Design

* Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
