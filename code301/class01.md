# Introduction to React and Components

## React

React is an open-source,front end,JS library created by FB. react is a user interface (UI) library. and tool for building UI components.

## What is React?

react only for the application’s view layer.the view layer of the model view controller architecture is in charge of how the app looks and sounds.

## Why React?

because its fast design of complex apps,improved usebiity , unidirectional data flow,small learning curve, and dedicated tools of quick debugging , its success has supassed that of any other front-end development framework .

## Rops in React

What is props short for? React is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.

## How are props used in React?

define an attribute and its value(data)
pass it to child component(s) by using Props
render the Props Data
What is the flow of props?

uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)


## charactistics of a component
Reusability − reused in different situations

Replaceable −. freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces

Independent − designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

## advantages of using component based architecture
* Ease of deployment
* Reduced cost
* Ease of development
* Reusable
* Modification of technical complexity
* Reliability
* System maintenance and evolution
* Independent
