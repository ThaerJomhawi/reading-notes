# Mongo and Mongoose

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL                      | NoSQL                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| relation database        | Non-relational database                                                    |
| good for complex queries | not a good fit for complex querie                                          |
| table based databases    | document-based databases, key-value stores,graph stores,wide column stores |
| vertically scalable      | horizontally scalable                                                      |
| pre-define schema        | dynamic schema                                                             |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

- SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

## Give a real world example.

-MS-SQL Server Express Edition

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

- the hierarchical data storage

## Give a real world example.

- Cassandra

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL database

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

- SQL database

###

## What does SQL stand for?

- Structured Query Language.

## What is a realational database?

- A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

- Structured Query Language like table , products table

## What is a ‘schema’?

- Schema is a framework or paradigm for the organization and interpretation of information.

## What is a NoSQL database?

- is a form of database which stores and allows access to connected data elements. The relationship data base is based on the relationship model "There has been a mistake

## Howo does it work?

- accommodate a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

- colloections and inside them there is docouments

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

- NoSQL databases are better with semi-structured and unstructured data and are generally more flexible than SQL databases.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

- NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID)
